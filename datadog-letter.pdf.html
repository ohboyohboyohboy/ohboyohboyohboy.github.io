      <p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://careers.datadoghq.com/detail/2147488/?gh_jid=2147488&amp;src=powertofly&amp;gh_src=b907b72c1us&amp;utm_source=powertofly">this job posting</a> on DataDog&#8217;s careers site and felt palpably excited. I would be a perfect fit for the position. I picked Ruby up in 2006 and quickly became a lifelong fan. Over the past 17 years, I have written scores of Ruby code, ranging from quick scripts to command line tools to intricate <a href="https://github.com/ohboyohboyohboy/antlr3">open source gems</a> to <a href="https://github.com/ohboyohboyohboy/path-string">native compiled extensions</a> to complex professional web applications. I spent the past 10+ years of my career working on commercial Ruby on Rails applications with large and small teams of engineers. I have a strong understanding of the CRuby implementation and can grasp what is happening on a lower machine code level as the source code executes. I know community style conventions in and out and write clean, readable, thoughtful, idiomatic Ruby code.</p>
<p>And though I consider Ruby one of my top areas of expertise, a quick review of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-yetter">my LinkedIn profile</a> shows I also have deep experience and training across multiple areas of the tech industry. I am a polyglot and programming language hobbyist comfortable writing code in many languages, including Python, JavaScript, C, <span class="caps">PHP</span>, and Perl. I learned about computer networking and internet protocols from my early time working for Sprint/Nextel. I mastered Linux and its associated toolchain as a senior system administrator at InMotion Hosting, a web hosting company. And I have worked as a developer and engineer for over ten years. I bring the strength of experience, critical thinking, and learning from prior mistakes.</p>
<p>At my most recent job, a gig-work company named Wonolo, I worked as a senior engineer on the company&#8217;s internal tools and integrations team. Unfortunately, the current economic climate hit Wonolo pretty strongly, and the company let most of my team go as part of a reduction in force. Thus, I am currently seeking a staff or senior-level software engineering position at a company where I hope to produce some of the finest engineering work of my career.</p>
<p>I used DataDog extensively at one of my previous employers, TaskRabbit. I grew to love and appreciate the quality of the tooling DataDog provides. It was indispensable in many situations: debugging obscure problems in requests; analyzing application performance to make optimizations;   measuring the success and usage of new features after release. I would be proud to be part of the DataDog team and contribute to its excellent set of products.</p>
<p>I want to note that I found this job from Google&#8217;s career posting search engine while browsing positions explicitly marked as 100% remote. Thus, I am presuming this role is open to a remote worker from the US. However, the job description does not explicitly indicate that this is the case. I apologize if I am mistaken, and there are rigid restrictions that would disqualify me. I would also be an excellent candidate for virtually any Ruby-oriented positions at a senior-to-staff level at DataDog.</p>
<p>As a highly-skilled professional with deep technical knowledge and experience, I value quality, thoughtfulness, collaboration, and relationships with humans. Please review my attached resume and application. If you agree that I fit the profile and skills for the position, don&#8217;t hesitate to contact me and schedule a conversation. I am excited to hear back from you.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Kyle Yetter</p>
