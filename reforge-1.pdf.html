<h2 style="margin-top: 0.2in;">My Background</h2>
<p>I am a thoroughly experienced software engineer who strives to retain a growth mindset. Having worked in technology since 2006, I have learned to value quality, thoughtfulness, collaboration, and relationships with humans. My career spans many industries, including telecommunications, education tech, and gig economy markets.</p>
<p>I am a polyglot developer, able to write and understand many different programming languages and paradigms. I do my most substantial development in Ruby, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python, with Ruby being my top expertise. I have written and maintained a wide gamut of code: quick-and-dirty scripts, polished command-line utilities, Linux packages, browser extensions, complex libraries, daemons, cron jobs, headless APIs, mobile apps, and production-grade web servers. I have successfully debugged, fixed, and prevented countless elusive bugs and obstacles.</p>
<p>For most of last year, I was a senior lead engineer at gig economy company Wonolo on its &#8220;Integrations and Internal Tools&#8221; team. Unfortunately, the recent unpredictable nature of the economy brought consequences for the business. In mid-April, Wonolo cut my team as part of a necessary reduction in force, and now I am back on the job market. I treasure the experience, growth, and friendship I acquired at Wonolo, and now I am eager to move into the next exciting career phase.</p>
<p>I am currently seeking a staff-level software engineering position at a small company where I may pursue some of the highest-quality engineering work of my career. Please review my attached resume and application. If you agree that I fit the profile and skills for the position, please get in touch with me and schedule a conversation. I am excited to explore my fit for this role with you.</p>
<p>Warmly,</p>
<p>Kyle Yetter</p>
