      <p>To Whom It May Concern At Handshake,</p>
<p>I am reaching out to apply to your job advertisement for <a href="https://joinhandshake.com/careers/open-roles/job?gh_jid=5068164">Staff Software Engineer, Core Experience</a>, which appears to be an excellent fit for my skill set. Further, I admire the mission of Handshake as a company and I am impressed with the characteristics the company has chosen to emphasize in this posting.</p>
<h2>Review of Qualifications</h2>
<p>While I have not officially held a staff level engineering position previously, I have held high seniority in my last three engineering positions. I have the depth of experience, discipline, cross-domain knowledge, and technical leadership required to succeed in a staff-level engineering role.</p>
<p>Before I get into the minutae of my employment history and current career search, I want to visit each bullet point in the position requirements to give a quick explanation of the way I satisfy it:</p>
<table class="requirements-table-3-col">
	<tr>
		<th>You Wantâ€¦ </th>
		<th></th>
		<th>I Supplyâ€¦ </th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">You prefer taking projects from inception to completion and are outcome-oriented. </td>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">ðŸ—¹ </td>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">I am a passionate, educated engineer with high standards cultivated through years of experience. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">You act with empathy when partnering with fellow engineers and coworkers. </td>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">ðŸ—¹ </td>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">I mentored and assisted many mid and junior level engineers as a significant part of my last two senior engineering positions spanning the last 4-5 years. I have learned to treat my coworkers with deep respect and appreciation, regardless of seniority. I deeply empathize and take care to give dignity to fellow engineers that are still early in their career journeys </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">You have 6+ years of experience in building full-stack web applications with a focus on back-end development. </td>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">ðŸ—¹ </td>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">I have over 10 years experience doing engineering work on production grade applications, including over 5 years of fullstack engineering work at eBackpack, with a greater focus on backend and systems level work at my last two employers. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">You are familiar with and passionate about software architecture patterns, such as Domain-Driven Design, Clean Code/Architecture, etc. </td>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">ðŸ—¹ </td>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">I have centered many of my designs around modeling domains. I have applied Domain-Driven Design to create my data model system to drive an online test authoring, deploying, scoring, and reporting system at eBackpack. <span class="caps">DDD</span> patterns also have frequently come up in my recent projects focused on working with third party vendor integrations. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">You have experience working in distributed, performant, at-scale event-driven and/or reactive architecture systems. </td>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">ðŸ—¹ </td>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">I have worked on many RoR-based stacks throughout my career and I have dealt with many forms of event-oriented architecture, including complex systems built around message queues </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">You have experience with data serialization / standardizing how data is exchanged between systems (e.g. Avro, Thrift, Json Schema, Protobuf). </td>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">ðŸ—¹ </td>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">I know common serialization formats very well â€“ <span class="caps">JSON</span>, <span class="caps">XML</span>, <span class="caps">YAML</span>, and <span class="caps">BSON</span>. I have incidental experience with using <span class="caps">JSON</span> Schema to describe data content, and I am aware of Apache Avro and Googleâ€™s Protobuf, but I will gladly put effort into learning and mastering this subject as Handshake requires </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">You are a strong engineer and passionate about how your technical decisions will affect product engagement and adoption. </td>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">ðŸ—¹ </td>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">I care deeply about the products and tools I create, and I truly believe my best work happens when I can fully empathize with the end users and the tasks they are trying to accomplish. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">You appreciate good documentation and procedures. </td>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">ðŸ—¹ </td>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">As most engineers know, code is read far more often than it is written. I believe in writing sensible, clean, readable, appropriately commented and annotated code. Then, larger scale documentation around how systems fit together or how to accomplish various tasks associated with the job are paramount to allowing other engineers to get up to speed quickly and to ensure your team members can accomplish your tasks. I am a huge supporter of documentation. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">You are proud of your craft and enjoy and value clean code that scales to keep large teams productive. </td>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">ðŸ—¹ </td>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;">I absolutely take pride in my craft, and I value clean, readable code that employs sensible techniques to avoid performance bottlenecks or weakness in scaling. </td>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">My Background</h2>
<p>I am a thoroughly experienced software engineer who strives to retain a growth mindset. Having worked in technology since 2006, I have learned to value quality, thoughtfulness, collaboration, and relationships with humans. My career spans many industries, including telecommunications, education tech, and gig economy markets.</p>
<p>I am a polyglot developer, able to write and understand many different programming languages and paradigms. I do my most substantial development in Ruby, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python, with Ruby being my top expertise. I have written and maintained a wide gamut of code: quick-and-dirty scripts, polished command-line utilities, Linux packages, browser extensions, complex libraries, daemons, cron jobs, headless APIs, mobile apps, and production-grade web servers. I have successfully debugged, fixed, and prevented countless elusive bugs and obstacles.</p>
<p>For most of last year, I was a senior lead engineer at gig economy company Wonolo on its &#8220;Integrations and Internal Tools&#8221; team. Unfortunately, the recent unpredictable nature of the economy brought consequences for the business. In mid-April, Wonolo cut my team as part of a necessary reduction in force, and now I am back on the job market. I treasure the experience, growth, and friendship I acquired at Wonolo, and now I am eager to move into the next exciting career phase.</p>
<p>I am currently seeking a staff-level software engineering position at a small, company where I may pursue some of the highest-quality engineering work of my career. Please review my attached resume and application. If you agree that I fit the profile and skills for the position, please get in touch with me and schedule a conversation. I am excited to explore my fit for this role with you.</p>
<p>Warmly,</p>
<p>Kyle Yetter</p>
